// Code to find the maximum path sum of any non-empty path. A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root. The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path ~ coded by Hiren

        `solveWithoutMemo` - Time complexity: O(N*N) 
                             Explanation: The total number of nodes is N and for each node we're calling the `solveWithoutMemo` function so the overall time complexity is O(N*N),
                                          where the `solveWithoutMemo` auxiliary time is O(N) its because the `solveWithoutMemo` is visiting all the nodes in the recursion.
                            
                           - Auxiliary space : O(N*3 + N)
                             Explanation: The first N*3 represents the overall space taken by the adjacency list. It's because for any node there can be at most 3 neighbours, its because we're dealing with a binary tree. 
                                          So as we're storing neighbours of each node thus the total space taken by the adjacency list is N*3.
                                          The second term N represents the maximum depth of the recursion stack.

        `solveWithMemo` - Time complexity: O(NLogN) 
                          Explanation: The size of the memoization table could be N*3 which can be simplified as N. As you could see that the table is an ordered map and we're doing operations such as insertion and searching in it, which takes logarithmic time. 
                                       More clearly both the insertion and searching will end up taking `Log(sizeofmap)` time. More clearly Log(N) time and as we're doing it for each node hence the overall time complexity becomes NLogN.
                                       
                        - Auxiliary space : O(N*3 + N*3 + N)
                          Explanation: The first N*3 represents the overall space taken by the adjacency list. It's because for any node there can be at most 3 neighbours, its because we're dealing with a binary tree. 
                                       So as we're storing neighbours of each node thus the total space taken by the adjacency list is N*3.
                                       The second N*3 represents the overall space taken by the memoization table. 
                                       It will store results for each state of "node and parent" and as we're dealing with a binary tree and even if we convert it to a graph then still for any node you could you have 3 different parents only so considering this the memoization table will end up storing results for O(N*3) states only.
                                       The third term N represents the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
