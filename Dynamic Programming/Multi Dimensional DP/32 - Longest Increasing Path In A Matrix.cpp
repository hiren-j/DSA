// Code to find the length of the longest increasing path in matrix. From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed) ~ coded by Hiren

DON'T IGNORE MUST READ: Creating a correct bottom-up solution for this problem is not possible because of how cells are visited and marked during recursion. Even if you convert the memoized (top-down) solution to bottom-up, it wonâ€™t work properly. 
                        The issue comes from the fact that, in the recursive solution, cells are marked as "visited" and "unvisited" at different stages, which can't be handled in a bottom-up approach. In many cases, even memoization fails when handling these visited/unvisited states. 
                        However, for this specific problem, memoization works fine, but the bottom-up approach still cannot manage the visited/unvisited states correctly.
