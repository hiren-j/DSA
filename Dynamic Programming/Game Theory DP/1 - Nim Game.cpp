            To determine if you can win the Nim game, consider the following:
    
            - For small numbers of stones (1 to 3), you can always win by taking all stones.
            - With exactly 4 stones, you will lose no matter how many stones you take (1, 2, or 3). Your opponent will always be left with a number of stones that eventually results in your loss.
            - With 5 to 7 stones, you can win. For example, with 5 stones, take 1 stone (you're playing optimally) then no matter how many stones the opponent will take (1, 2, or 3), as your turn comes in you'll win by taking the rest of all the stones.
            - The pattern continues with every set of 4 stones. For any number of stones that is a multiple of 4 (like 4, 8, 12, 16, ...), you are guaranteed to lose if both players play optimally.
            - So, if the number of stones is not a multiple of 4, you can force the game into a situation where your opponent could not win.
    
            Therefore, you can win if the number of stones is not a multiple of 4.
