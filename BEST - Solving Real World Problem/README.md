✨ **Title:** Mastering the Rubik's Pyramid: Creating Patterns Without Even Looking! 💡🎯✨  

🌟 **Initial Note:** This video showcases why DSA is my all-time favorite subject. A perfect blend of logic, observation, and real-world problem-solving—just like coding!  

🤔 **Question:** How did I achieve this?  

👉🏻 **Intuition Breakdown:**  
I began by exploring the pyramid's mechanics, much like analyzing a coding problem. Within the first 5 days, I developed a brute force solution through my thought process on **permutations and backtracking.** Over time, I refined my observations and gained the ability to create intricate patterns. The real challenge came when I aimed to do it **blindfolded.** Although it felt impossible initially, persistent practice turned this goal into reality. The experience mirrored coding’s power to train your mind to tackle **any problem with precision.**
