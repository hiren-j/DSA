✨Title: Solving and creating different patterns in the Rubik's Pyramid without even looking at it 💥🔥💥

✌🏻Initial Note: This video is one of the reasons of why DSA is my favorite subject. This is a real-world example of my coding skill. It's all about DSA!

🤔Ques: How I did so?

👉🏻Brief Of My Intuition: I made a lot of observations in the pyramid. I just applied my thoughts as I do with any coding problem, and I created my first ever brute force solution to solve this pyramid in the first 5 days of taking it. 
The concept of permutations (Backtracking) helped me to build the brute force approach. As the time passed, I also tried new observations on it, and along with practicing them, my thoughts and observations became more intuitive on creating patterns in the pyramid. 
After being able to create patterns, I tried to create them without looking at the pyramid, and at first it didn't helped, but still I tried. After a lot of practice, I finally conquered the thing, and that's how I with a lot of practise I created a lot of observations to create a lot of different kinds of patterns without even looking at the pyramid. So, that's how programming (problem-solving skills) opens your mind in such a way that you can solve any kind of problem.

😊Final Note: Practice does improvement, you just need to try consistently! I hope this inspires you to dive into the world of programming!
